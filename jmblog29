There are other places to get help on the internet like the BGG design forums or the BGDF, but I‚Äôve found this year that Facebook has served me well. I personally run 3 or 4 groups/pages but there are many more that are active.
I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time recently, attempting to keep discussions relevant to the page they are posted to. Face it, who has the time to read dozens of posts each day ‚Äì especially if they are not relevant to your current interests.
So, I thought I‚Äôd share a listing of pages that I find most helpful on Facebook. Be kind and don‚Äôt pollute.
