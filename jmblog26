This list is regularly updated.
My post about Manufacturers was very well received and I got a request to do one about distributors. I do get asked from time to time to provide this info anyway, so I might as well make a page about it, right?
There are a couple types of distributors and just a few large ones that dominate the US market. There are also fulfillment/consolidation services that help you get easy access to all these distributors and a warehouse to store your products. So it’s important to note the differences.
At the same time, many of them have alternate forms of doing business with you (a publisher). Some will allow you to do what’s known as “Flooring” – which means they will charge you a fee for space in their warehouse and will buy from you on consignment (thus only paying you if / when your product sells). The advantage of Flooring is that the distributor doesn’t run out of inventory – which is a major problem in this short-order front-line driven marketplace we live in today.
I do not recommend working directly with the distributors unless you’re a larger publisher. If you use a consolidator they will more then pay for their services by getting your game sold more often and to more companies than you could ever do on your own.
Also, see my post on how to get into distribution as a new publisher:http://www.jamesmathe.com/how-to-get-into-distribution/

Fulfillment Centers
These services will help you ship your game around the world to your end customers (like Kickstarter backers). They are good to use to help avoid your customers paying import/VAT taxes on the goods as you can ship within the EU. This is usually called being “EU Friendly”. Also, since shipping out of the USA is so damn expensive, your costs in the end (even though you pay the VAT on the wholesale price of your goods) ends up being less in the end. But it is more work / logistics.  My company, Minion Games, ships to only USA backers and has one of these services send to all the non-USA backers (even Canada).

                            UK also has ourselves and we do distribution and fulfilment, we’re working on a tie up with Game Salute and have been their UK Distributor for a while.
Coiled Spring are ideal if your game is targeted at the younger market.

                            Really rookie questions here from someone just trying to figure out this industry.
If I was to work with a Consolidator and Manufacturer.  Do Consolidators handle initial order fulfillment if we did a Kickstarter?
What about future order fulfillment if we set up a website for online order?  Do Consolidators handle those or do they just handle working with distributors to get games into stores?
Thank you so much for all this great information!!!

                            Some consolidators do, most don’t. Online orders are on you, not your consolidator. They really only help you get into distribution. There are fulfilment companies like Games Quest that can help you ship Kickstarter.

                            James , your blog is awesome and is a big help. I owned a game store a while back (sold it when I moved closed to family) and am planning to open a new store. One thing I was wondering as far as distributors go, Alliance and GTS and such have hobby games and ccgs. Where do you find generic stuff like Parcheesi, Dominoes, chess sets, checkers sets, etc. Thanks for the help!

                            Most of the time you don’t want to deal in them unless they are premium wood versions as anyone who’s price sensitive will just go to Walmart, Target, or Toys R’ Us.  So there are a couple places that do nice wood stuff like Wood Expressions. You’ll have to order direct most likely.

                            Hi James, We have a new game we have currently stocked in our own storage but I’m having trouble trying to figure out how to get a consolidator. Where might I contact one for Seattle WA? We are looking for a way to get our game noticed. Any advice on how to do that? People like the game but nobody knows it exists. We have a website and facebook and two stores holding it but by ourselves it’s very slow going. Is a consolidator what we are looking for?
Thanks!

                            You really should have been in talks before you printed the game. It’s extremely hard to get into distribution these days unless your game is already a known quantity – face it 2000 other people are in your shoes. Stores are getting too much product already. Your really on your own with going to conventions and promoting the game yourself these days. I have other blogs mentioning how to promote yourself.

                            I’m a bit confused on the basic functions of the links in the chain.  Assuming a designer creates the game at the beginning, and a retailer sells the game at the end, would you mind talking a bit about the difference between a distributer, a consolidator, a fulfillment center, and a publisher?
Thanks!

                            Sure, the quick answer is:
Game Designer – they person with the game idea who made a working prototype that is fun to play. They usually pitch this to a Publisher to make it into a complete product to sell to retailers.
Publisher – the person who thought up and planned and executed (like a movie producer) a game idea. Most of the time they are just outsourcing to contractors like artists, game designers, etc. They are also the ones that put up the money and take the risk on the production of that game.
Fulfillment Center – This is a company that helps you direct ship to end customers as a publisher. Usually used to fill the Kickstarter to backers. They really are only there to help you sort/pack/ship and are not taking any orders from anyone but the publisher.
Consolidator – these days there are so many small companies, another middleman steps in to help out. Since it’s hard to get into distribution (as a publisher) these days, if you can get into a consolidator they will then sell to the distributor. Thus your products will get restocked at the distributor more often.
Distributor – a company the retailers order from that has many items from many publishers in stock. This saves them time and shipping.
