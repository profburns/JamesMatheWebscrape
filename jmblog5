People are regularly wanting to hire me to do consulting work for them… But, I’m semi-retired now and don’t really enjoy that kind of work. When told that, most ask who I’d recommend to help them out. While I don’t really wish to play favorites, I did put together this list of professionals that may help you out. I did not vet any of these and do not endorse any, this is merely a list for you to start to find the help you seek.
Note this table below has a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom. Bio info is to the far right.
Also, you can click any column to sort by that column. Find the service column you’re interested in, click it twice and all the people offering that will be on the top of the list for your review.
WARNING: I have not vetted and I am not recommending or endorsing any of these people. They submit the info they want listed to me and I post it. I do not have the time to verify or rate them. Make sure you do your own background checks.
If you wish to be added to this list use the contact page to send me all the column data.

                            Vaughn Reynolds was awesome to work with on the Monster Dice campaign. He went above and beyond by setting up mailchimp emails, pre-marketing, Kickstarter page review before launch, FB ADS, responding to messages when I was unable, proofreading updates, and because of his extra effort the campaign was successful.
