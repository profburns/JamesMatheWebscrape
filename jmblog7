Ok, so I’m not a Vampire and I’m not as good looking as Brad Pitt… But apparently some people felt it worth their while to interview me over the last few years – and hey, I needed a catchy title.
This is a post that I’m going to use to keep track of the rare interviews I’ve done online. I’m not a fan of doing them so I don’t usually accept offers for them. But I have done enough now that I suppose I should list them all in one place. Enjoy…
