The Enlightened Path to Virtual Popularity
¬†

I‚Äôve seen many great looking games or great ideas just languish on Kickstarter and they really did a good job with their campaign page. So what went wrong? In almost all these cases the project creators came out of the woodwork as an unknown until the day they posted their project. Crowd Funding sites (including the big mall of a site: Kickstarter) cannot promote your project on their own enough to get funded. It is certainly not a case of posting it and they will come!
Much of your success on a crowd funding site depends on your social network / reach. You need to begin working on this weeks before you plan to launch your campaign. You need to have several hundred likes on Facebook and hundreds of followers on Twitter as well as a presence on many other social sites, forums and blogs. You will also need to start working on creating a direct mailing list. These sources can account for 25-50% of your funding!
First, a couple general notes from the marketing guru Alexi Vandenberg of Rabid Fanboy‚Ä¶
Your website isn‚Äôt as important as your mailing list and social networking. People don‚Äôt ‚Äúfind‚Äù your website on their own ‚Äì they find it from marketing. The back your project on Kickstarter not your website. So it‚Äôs your marketing that needs the most exposure, and you usually want to point them to Kickstarter, not your website. Sure your website is still important but don‚Äôt waste a disproportional amount of time and money on it.
As a creator your project is important, do not take anything personal. If a donor asks a question it is probably because he doesn‚Äôt understand the project and is honestly curious. I have seen many creators get very short if someone asks a question regarding the product. That is more detrimental than they realize because that person has friends. It only takes one example of obnoxiousness or rudeness for someone to change their mind about buying your product and, on the internet, such examples can travel widely, especially in fandom circles.
Don‚Äôt panic with the doldrums. Sales and fund-raising has ebbs and flows. If funding has stopped completely then there is a problem; but if it slows or is moving in fits and starts but is still going towards your goal, do not suddenly change your entire marketing strategy to make it more ‚Äúsexy‚Äù. Marketing is sometimes not so much flashy as it is steady messaging. Changing suddenly smacks of something going wrong and undermines confidence in your product.
Now onto the meat‚Ä¶
GETTING LIKES, FOLLOWS &amp; MAILING LISTS?

On Any Site
Follow / Friend others and they will do the same back
Make sure your fans are part of the conversation. Ask questions or seek feedback. Engagement is key.
Be a part of the community, ask questions and engage conversations
Post regular, informative, and helpful posts and replies
Always include pictures and/or links in everything you post.
Reply to other people‚Äôs posts and tweets, don‚Äôt just like them.
Get others to share your posts and retweet your messages.
Leave relevant comments on other people‚Äôs blogs and leave your FB page URL
Reach out to bloggers, podcasters, news sites and more to at least mention your product page.
Attempt to reach outside the industry/gamer sites to find people who may be interested in the theme/topic of your game. Try comic book sites for example.
Encourage posts to Reddit about your project.
Join Meetup.com groups and attend Events in your area playing games
Post/tweet/share pictures of people actually playing your game
Run a Contest or a Fan of the Month promotion
Facebook
Create a group for your game or company. Then run a contest to give something away to people who join it. Groups are much better than a page because when you post to them everyone gets a notice, whereas with a page only 5% or less do (sometimes even when promoting the post in the page).
Share other Facebook posts of similar products
Link to your Facebook page in your signature on forum posts
Join other groups on Facebook
Post interesting stuff to OTHER groups/pages besides your own or your own feed
Install a LIKE button or Widget or Feed on your website or blog ‚Äì https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/
Create/share things that are interesting or inspiring or funny to gamer geeks
Use Interactive YouTube annotations to drive likes from your videos
Link to your Facebook page from your Linked-in profile
Create a poll for people to vote on.
Pay to promote a post with a great picture on your page.
Promote LIKES as a stretch goal in your campaign
Use a ‚ÄúLIKE-Gate‚Äù tab on your page for exclusive content reveal, such as game rules or some PnP content. http://ustandout.com/facebook/how-to-promote-your-facebook-pages-like-gate-tab-to-get-more-likes
Use status tagging ‚Äì Status tagging is a cool and fairly new feature of Facebook This feature allows you to tag any page or person by entering the @ sign and then typing the name of the page or person you want to tag.
Connect your Facebook page to Twitter and allow it to tweet your posts. https://www.facebook.com/twitter/
Find yourself more friends ‚Äì http://www.facebook.com/find-friends/
Take small fliers (with QR codes pointing to your FB page) to events &amp; conventions you attend
Run a demo at your local gaming stores and give participants your flier
If you can find a way to highly target the audience for a FB add and you have a budget, you can get some likes for 10-25 cents each.
Obviously, invite your friends to your page üôÇ
FACEBOOK ADS:¬†The key to ads on FB is the narrowing of your target audience. Make sure you only target the US, Canda, and EU and try to only target people who also like popular games in our market. Also, if you have a mailing list, upload it and let it parse it up ‚Äì then run a campaign that reaches 1 or 2% look-alike accounts.¬†In short, FB ads work and quite well when done well. But you need to highly target your audience and have multiple images / add copy being used to grab attention. Then put more money into the ones that seem to be resonating. You‚Äôll need to spend $50 or more. These things are done through the Ads Manager. Don‚Äôt just promote a post, make an ad.
Twitter
Use # tags, like #boardgames, to alert people of your topic
Use @username to get the attention of key people (don‚Äôt use more than 2 or 3 per tweet or you‚Äôll get flagged for spamming)
Follow the ‚Äúsmores‚Äù (social media whores) ‚Äì All the board game or RPG people you can find, many will follow you back.
Re-tweet others who tweet things of interest to you
Asking for follows and retweets on Twitter is acceptable.
Mailing List
Use SurveyMonkey.com where you can get input from 100 people for free‚Ä¶ so why not ask questions about what people want out of your game or campaign? When they fill out your short (3-4 questions) survey you can ask for their email address
Collect emails from your contests
When running demos collect people‚Äôs email addresses
Get emails from previous campaigns you‚Äôve run
Use a subscribe form on your website
¬†
THE DON‚ÄôT‚Äôs

Don‚Äôt waste your time on Fiverr.com or other paid likes sites.
Avoid outright asking everyone for likes/follows (friends are OK)
In general don‚Äôt pay for broad FB ads to get likes (they will cost you too much and are not quality likes)
Don‚Äôt plan your success around getting staff picks, they are not as integral to success as you might think.
Don‚Äôt spam groups or pages that are for discussions, instead ask for feedback about your product or campaign on them.
¬†

SOCIAL NETWORKING
Avoid using Social Networking only as an advertising platform to push product. See it as a place to have a conversation and gather feedback about your product. Posting product info isn‚Äôt bad, but it can quickly wear thin.
The number-one rule for success within a community or social platform is to engage in the relevant conversations that are taking place and add value when doing so.
Tell users how the feedback you get from them is impacting your business and what you‚Äôre doing with the feedback. Few people will give suggestions or feedback if they know the company ignores it.
Use the follow friends on Kickstarter to share purchases
The comments on your project should be considered social networking as well and you should remain engaged (especially in the first and final days).
Facebook (1-5 times a week)
Make a company and/or product page on Facebook
Create an easy-to-remember URL ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/username
Create a good-looking page with nice header and fill out the ABOUT section.
Remember, each posting to your page only reaches a small percentage of your follower‚Äôs news feeds.
Promoting posts for $5 or $10 works (if you want to reach outside the country you live in you need to setup an ad manually)
Targeted Ads ‚Äì if you do spend money on ads on FB make sure they are highly targeted. Make sure you target just a couple countries (USA, Canada, UK, Australia, and German¬†are the big ones)
Create a launch party event and invite people to it so they feel a part of the event
Say something with context, not just ‚Äì HEY BACK MY CAMPAIGN!
LIKE the comments left about your posts.
Post to promotion pages like: https://www.facebook.com/KickstarterGamesFan
Google+ (1-3 times a week)
There are two types of accounts on G+ ‚Äî a personal account, and a business page. Create a business page: http://www.google.com/+/business
Being search engine driven, make sure you include Keywords and Relevant Links on your about page
The things that separates Google+ from Facebook is that brands can appear at the top of Google search results as well as status updates.
Google Events feature allows Google+ users to send out customized invitations to anyone regardless of whether they are Google+ users. It syncs with Google Calendar and shows up automatically when a user confirms for an event.
Join the many game groups found on Google+
With Circles, you can segment their followers. They can sort by different customer types, new customers, old customers, prospective customers, etc
You can take advantage of Circles by sending coupons to just prospective customers or having specials for current customers
Hangouts (chat/video rooms) can be used during the final hours of your event to help drive the hype and backing frenzy. Give it sort of a party feel. I‚Äôve personally seen hundreds of dollars added by existing backers in attempts to meet the next stretch goals.
Google is YouTube, and integration of videos is a key factor in Google+
Twitter (3+ times daily)
Get a Twitter account and plan to keep up the tweeting, it‚Äôs not hard
Re-tweet the other people who tweet about your product or things similar
Thank people for re-tweeting you.
Judiciously include # hashtags like #boardgames or #gencon when you post
Follow everyone who follows you
Small talk on Twitter goes a long way toward building brand loyalty.
Share interesting things and topics not just your own spam. Be kind and click other people‚Äôs TWEET buttons on their blogs and sites.
Tweet whenever you back someone else‚Äôs project.
Tweet during USA peak times such the evening.
Keep your posts short enough to retweet. Remember it adds text when you do.
LinkedIn (Once a week)
Join and make some posts to game groups
Follow others active in the gaming groups.
Make profile updates when you have some big news like launch or updates.
Pinterest (as needed)
Your game should look cool, right? Some bits look especially cool! Post them here for people to share and look at.
YouTube (as needed)
Post all your videos to YouTube as well as Kickstarter (or whichever) as YouTube has its own social aspects.
Use annotations to point to your product &amp; pages.
Don‚Äôt forget you can share video on most social networks as well as pictures, so share your videos!
Reddit (Once per forum)
Posts to just promote your product are frowned on and won‚Äôt get you much of anywhere
Post a topic/subject that‚Äôs engaging
Reply to other posts in your categories
Schedule a Reddit IAMA ‚Äì Ask Me Anything event
Forums: /r/boardgames, /r/boardgamedesign, /r/kickstarter, /r/rpg, /r/tabletop, /r/Pathfinder_RPG
¬†

COMMUNITY REACH
You don‚Äôt want to pollute forums and such you‚Äôve never been to before, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt start building connections to those sites now. Find forums that are for similar interests, join their conversations, ask questions, be friendly, and when your campaign does launch you can more naturally invite them to check it out.

MARKETING YOUR CAMPAIGN

Reach out to other campaigns that might share a similar customer base and work out a deal to promote each other
Create a custom avatar for the campaign so others can use it to show support
Share your updates to other pages and groups on all the social networks
When your campaign is live direct people to the kickstarter page, not the Facebook or your publisher pages. Each click a potential customer has to make you lose 20% more ROI.
Add your campaign to Stumble Upon ‚Äì http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit
Do an E-mail blast at start of campaign and again a week before it ends.
Do a Reddit IAMA (Ask Me Anything) event during your campaign.
An update is an excuse to market and a call to action. Make sure you use it as such with images and encourage people to come pledge or raise their pledge.
Spread out your updates. Don‚Äôt post more then one a day and 3 a week.
After the initial buzz dies down about your campaign, start to post review links, videos, and your designer blog. One a day at most, spread them out. These give you a great reason to get mentioned in site news and other blogs and promote your campaign.
On the last day of the campaign make sure the front page of your Kickstarter has a link to point back to your website. Once the campaign ends, you will not be able to update your Kickstarter front page.
MARKETING YOUR GAME
UPDATE 2018: I posted a poll on a game industry forum where retailers, publishers, and distributors could reply and got this great feedback when asking what they feel has influanced their sales/purchasing the most:

And when we gave the same poll to consumers (granted a biased group of online Facebook users) we see a shift in what they feel is most important:

                            Another great post! This certainly took a long time, will definitely go in as a bookmarked page. Love the paid advertising section, great starting point and it will save me a lot of money and headache trying to figure out why one advertising isn‚Äôt working over another. Thank you for taking the time to do this! It goes a LONG way to those of us who are just starting out.

                            It might be noteworthy to list if they cost money for reviews (Dice Tower, Undead).

                            To, Mr. James Mathe,
   I am Chandrakant Deshpande from India. I did contact you before regarding selling my board game to a USA based publisher. If I send you details about my board game and my project, will you inform me details about Kick starting my project, including project cost, my own investment needed, possibility of acquiring angel investment, etc.

                            Chandrakant, I have a consulting company that does that at http://www.KickinItGames.com and there is a fee for it. Prices are on the website.

                            I send a lot of people that I consult with this way, in fact I did another recommend last night. So I decided to pull up a few of the articles again for a refresher (always good stuff). As one of the hosts of All Us Geeks; I‚Äôd like to throw my hat in for the Kickstarter friendly review list. ;-}
We do a lot of Kickstarter related audio reviews on the podcast, game preview videos on our YouTube channel, and we have the stand alone segment The Game of Crowd Funding where we give projects owners a chance to discuss their projects along with lessons they‚Äôve learned along the way.

                            I just wanted to thank you for the wealth of information you are providing here. As someone who is thinking about running a Kickstarter campaign for my game, this is all extremely helpful! Looking forward to learning more from you.

                            Thank you, James for reposting the link to this list on one of the Facebook forums. It really is what I have been looking for. Your blogs are so vast, that it is getting hard to navigate through all of it. So, when I get directed right to the perfect information‚Ä¶its AWESOME! Thank you!
